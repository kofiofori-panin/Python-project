# Assignment given and its solution below
# 1.  Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format below:
#
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# 	How I wonder what you are!
# 		Up above the world so high,
# 		Like a diamond in the sky.
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# 	How I wonder what you are


# 2.  Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius entered by the user

# 3. Use string concatenation and the len() function to find the length of a certain  movie #star's actual full name. Store that length in the name_length variable. Don't forget that there are spaces in between the different parts of a name
given_name = "William"
middle_names = "Bradley"
family_name = "Pitt"

# todo: calculate how long this name is â€“ Enter your code here


# Now we check to make sure that the name fits within the driving license character limit
# Nothing you need to do here
# print(name_length)
driving_license_character_limit = 28

# 4. # use at least 5 string functions to modify the string below.

text = 'this is just a sentence'
# Example - print(text.upper())


# 5. The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff


# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable


# increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
# into the reservoir in the days following the storm


# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation


# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
# that's piped to arid regions.


# print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable (1 mark)


# 6. Fix the error
days = 30
print(days + 'days in some months')


# 7. write code To check if the phrase "wife" is in a string. Tip: Use the 'in' keyword

shortText = "We are looking for a wife."
